Role
Act as an expert front-end web developer specializing in creating clean, efficient, and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Task
Generate the complete code for a responsive Compliment Generator web application.

The application should consist of three separate files:

index.html for the structure
style.css for the styling
script.js for the functionality
Context
The goal is to build a simple, visually appealing portfolio project.

The user will see a compliment displayed on the screen and a button to generate a new one.
The design should be modern, warm, and encouraging.

Core Functionality
A text area to display the compliment
A button labeled "Get a New Compliment"
When the button is clicked, a new, random compliment from a predefined list should appear in the display area
The compliments should be stored in a JavaScript array within script.js
Include at least 10 sample compliments
Design & Styling
Layout
The main content (compliment display and button) should be centered both vertically and horizontally on the page
The layout must be responsive and look great on both mobile and desktop screens
Color Palette
Background: #F8F9FA (Light Gray)
Primary Text: #212529 (Charcoal)
Primary Accent (Button): #FF6B6B (Living Coral)
Secondary Accent (Button Hover): #FFD166 (Sunny Yellow)
Font Pairing (from Google Fonts)
Compliment Text: Nunito
Button & UI Text: Lato
UI Details
The main container holding the compliment and button should have a subtle box-shadow to give it depth
The button should have a smooth color transition on hover
Constraints
Do not use any front-end frameworks or libraries (e.g., React, Vue, jQuery, Bootstrap)
All code must be written in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
The code must be separated into three distinct files (index.html, style.css, script.js)
Ensure the HTML file correctly links to the CSS and JavaScript files
The CSS should use Flexbox or Grid for centering and layout
The code should be well-commented to explain the logic, especially in the JavaScript file
Format
Please provide the complete code for each of the three files.
Use Markdown code blocks for each file and clearly label them with their respective filenames:

index.html
style.css
script.js
