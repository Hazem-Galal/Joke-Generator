Role
You are a senior frontend engineer and product-minded UX designer. You build clean, modern, accessible interfaces with polished micro-interactions and maintainable vanilla JavaScript architecture. You think like a project strategist: every feature exists to demonstrate user-centric product thinking, execution quality, and clear portfolio storytelling for recruiters and hiring managers.

Task
Build a “Compliment Generator” portfolio project as a single-page static website using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks like React). The experience should feel modern, friendly, and professional—optimized to impress technical recruiters, engineering managers, and frontend peers.

Core Goals
1) Human value: deliver delight and emotional uplift through well-written, context-aware compliments.
2) Execution excellence: responsive, accessible UI; clean code structure; smooth interactions.
3) Strategic framing: include lightweight product rationale and “what this demonstrates” for portfolio reviewers.

Required Core Functionality
- Generate compliments on demand with high variety (avoid repeats; rotate templates).
- Personalization inputs (all optional):
  - Name (text)
  - “Who is this for?” (e.g., Developer, Designer, Student, Manager, Friend)
  - Tone (e.g., Professional, Friendly, Playful)
  - Focus (e.g., Skills, Effort, Creativity, Leadership, Kindness)
- Primary CTA: “Generate Compliment”
- Secondary actions:
  - “Regenerate” (new compliment with same inputs)
  - “Copy to Clipboard” (with success feedback)
  - “Save Favorite” (store locally)
  - “View Favorites” panel (list + delete)
- Persist state using localStorage:
  - Last generated compliment
  - Favorites list
  - Basic counters (e.g., total generated)
- UX states:
  - Empty state before first generation
  - Loading state (simulate 250–600ms for polish)
  - Error handling (e.g., clipboard permission fallback)
- Accessibility:
  - Semantic HTML
  - Labels for inputs
  - Keyboard support for all actions
  - Visible focus states
  - ARIA only when needed
- Responsive design:
  - Mobile-first layout
  - Clean card-based UI
  - Comfortable spacing and typography
- “About / What this demonstrates” section for recruiters:
  - Brief bullets explaining UX thinking, accessibility, state management, localStorage, and code structure.

UI / Visual Style Requirements
- Use a clean modern palette and font pairing:
  - Palette (Option 1):
    - Background: #0F172A
    - Surface/Card: #111827
    - Primary Accent: #38BDF8
    - Secondary Accent: #22C55E
    - Text Primary: #F8FAFC
    - Text Secondary: #94A3B8
  - Fonts:
    - Headings: Poppins (600–700)
    - Body: Inter (400–500)
- Add subtle micro-interactions:
  - Button hover/press
  - Card shadow/scale on hover (desktop)
  - Smooth fade/slide for generated compliment and toast messages
- Keep the UI calm and premium (no clutter). Use accents sparingly.

Technical Constraints
- Deliver as a single runnable `index.html` file.
- All CSS must be inside a <style> tag; all JS inside a <script> tag.
- No external build tools, no bundlers, no frameworks.
- You may use Google Fonts via <link> tags.
- Code must be clean, commented, and organized into small functions/modules (within the single file).
- Use `performance.now()` for any timing and avoid unnecessary reflows.
- Avoid global variables where possible (use a single app state object and encapsulated functions).

Quality Bar
- The result should look and feel like a real product.
- Provide thoughtful empty/loading/error states.
- Ensure no broken flows on mobile.
- Ensure favorites and copy work reliably.
- Keep the code readable and portfolio-ready.

Output Format
Return the full, final `index.html` only—complete and ready to copy-paste and run locally in a browser.

I would like to suggest to the AI, I would like to have a total of 100 unique compliments. Let's see how close it can actually get to 100. Try to make some of them funny or more unique, keeping the humor family-friendly, of course. And I would like the box not to change sizes for different compliments. Maybe it should be taller vertically instead of horizontally. And lastly, it is also pretty boring visually. Can you figure out a way to make it more interesting, either with animations, gradients, images, or emojis, or something like that
I would like the box to be vertically taller, it still is changing sizes with each compliment. I would still like it to be more visually interesting than this

I would like the main container to look like a playing card, have a circle in the top right and bottom left that is a different color each time. You can place emojis or Font Awesome icons or something inside. Try to have a wide variety. I want this card to have a fixed width and height and I want it to be the dimensions of a playing card. Okay, so there's that part. And then I also want to move the button outside of the card, remove the emoji inside it, and add a second button for generating jokes. I would like there to be an array with 50 different jokes, family-friendly as well. If there's a setup and a punchline, animate in the punchline after a few seconds. And lastly, I still would like the background to be more visually interesting.
